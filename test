The world was just about to change for the good or the worst, with the help from the former dragon celeste
and a group of strangers the end was uncertain, the dragon was dead, as soon as the sun died,
the guard's moral was at its lowest, in no time a leader rise among the last samurais,
defeated by the ghost's king from the old kingdom of Kazuro.
