The remaining  soldiers was too weak to travel, there was not enough time
to save the prince, the ghost's king was coming to the white dragon's temple

to take over the kingdom of Kazura, the last samurai lead by KiYzumi was about to
head on to the ghost king's army waiting to put a end of the samurai dynasty.
for good but nonetheless the dragon wasn't dead there was still hope,
the victory was near.
